# Web-Scraping

In this project I have scraped data from E-commerce website flipkart.com by using Python modules: requests and BeautifulSoup. 
URL of first page: https://www.flipkart.com/mobiles/mi~brand/pr?sid=tyy%2C4io&otracker=nmenu_sub_Electronics_0_Mi&page=1
Data is scraped from multiple pages in one go.

Data Columns: Mobile Name, Rating, Number of Ratings, Storage, Screen, Camera, Battery, Type of Processor and Price.
